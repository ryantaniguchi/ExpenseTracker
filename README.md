# Overview

This program acts as a simple expense tracker. A user provides their income for the month, then lists various expenses that they anticipate. The program checks to ensure that the user is not exceeding their income, and stores expenses into a hashmap. This information is both printed to the screen and stored to a .txt file. Finally, the program prints a breakdown of the expenses, showing the user what percentage of their income is going towards each expense.

My purpose for writing this program ws to introduce myself to the Java programming language. Through writing this program, I was able to become more familiar with the particulars of the language, including syntax, data structures, and packages.
